## Radial glia

*work in progress*

This repository contains the code used for analyzing data presented in the manuscript "Dissecting the spatiotemporal diversity of adult neural stem cells" by Mitic N.<sup>\*</sup>, Neuschulz A.<sup>\*</sup> et al (2023).

The analysis is divided into folders correponding to different figures:  
* Adult brain - cell type clustering and gene expression analysis of the adult zebrafish brain scRNAseq dataset (Fig. 1, Fig. 2)  
* Larval comparison - comparison of adult cell types from this dataset with larval cell types published in the paper by Raj B. et al (2020) (Fig. 3A)
* Lineage tracing - clonal analysis of lineage relationships between larval cell types at 5 dpf (Fig. 3B)  
* RNA velocity - region-specific differentiation trajectories based on RNA velocity (Fig. 4)  
* Metabolic labeling - *in vivo* labeling with the scSLAMseq method in the zebrafish telencephalon (Fig. 5)
* slam-velocity - using the scSLAMseq data to generate differentiation trajectories (Fig. 5)

### Data and scripts description  

The datasets presented in the manuscript are: scRNA-seq of the adult zebrafish brain, lineage tracing of the adult brain based on developmental lineage barcoding and a SLAM-seq dataset of the adult telencephalon with Notch pathway pertrbation. All datasets can be downloaded from GEO. Additional files necessary for the analysis are included in the folders along with the scripts.
